## Overview

**E.L.B.E.R.R.** is a fanmade animatronic project inspired by the robot featured
in the animations from [LIGHTS ARE OFF](https://www.youtube.com/@LIGHTSAREOFF).

The goal of this project is to recreate the character as a physical animatronic
robot using a custom local AI system, embedded motor control, sensors, and
purpose-built hardware. E.L.B.E.R.R. is designed as a self-contained robot that
can process information locally, control its own actuators, and respond through
real-time embedded systems.

> This is an unofficial fan project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
> produced by LIGHTS ARE OFF.

# Architecture Changes

## Core Concept

E.L.B.E.R.R. is built around a three-processor architecture:

* A **Raspberry Pi 5** acts as the primary computer, running the local AI system, behavior engine, perception, and overall robot coordination.
* An **ESP32-S3** serves as the communication and sensing processor, handling environmental sensors, wireless connectivity, and RF communication.
* An **STM32** microcontroller is dedicated to real-time servo and actuator control, ensuring smooth, deterministic motion and reliable animatronic performance.

This separation allows each processor to focus on a specific task while keeping motion control isolated from higher-level software.

The Raspberry Pi 5, ESP32-S3, and STM32 communicate with one another over UART.

## Raspberry Pi 5

The Raspberry Pi 5 is the central computer of E.L.B.E.R.R.

Its responsibilities include:

* Running the local AI system
* Managing high-level robot behavior
* Processing camera, microphone, and perception data
* Coordinating communication between all processors
* Handling networking, logging, and debugging
* Making behavioral decisions before sending motion commands to the STM32

The Pi is responsible for what the robot **thinks**.

---

## ESP32-S3

The ESP32-S3 is dedicated to sensing and wireless communication.

Its responsibilities include:

* Reading environmental sensors
* Monitoring digital and analog inputs
* Handling RF and wireless communication
* Forwarding sensor information to the Raspberry Pi 5
* Providing low-power peripheral management

The ESP32-S3 is responsible for what the robot **perceives** and how it communicates with external devices.

---

## STM32

The STM32 is dedicated to real-time motion control.

Its responsibilities include:

* Driving servos and animatronic actuators
* Generating precise PWM outputs
* Executing smooth motion profiles
* Enforcing movement limits
* Monitoring actuator timing
* Executing commands received from the Raspberry Pi 5

The STM32 is responsible for how the robot **moves**.
